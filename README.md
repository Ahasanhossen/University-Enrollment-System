## Description

During Enrollment, sometimes it happens that, student has exceeded the limit of credit. And sometimes a student canâ€™t enroll as the section has already the maximum number of students enrolled. Then manual entry is given.

All the procedures for enrollment of an university has been implemented in this project. During enrollment, while a student selects a course, if there is any limit, then message will be shown immediately. Option for the teacher will also be available to give the manual entry. Besides, this project will generate a list of overlapped courses after pre-enrollment which will be helpful for teachers to make class routine. This project assumes that the routine is not yet completed. The aim of this project is to find those courses having no overlapping students.
